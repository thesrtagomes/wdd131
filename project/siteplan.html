      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        "Flowers are nature's delicate masterpiece, each bloom a testament to
        the beauty that can flourish even in the harshest conditions. They
        symbolize growth, renewal, and the cycle of life, reminding us that even
        after the coldest winters, there is always the promise of spring. Their
        colors and fragrances bring joy and peace to our senses, turning
        ordinary spaces into places of beauty and reflection. Flowers speak a
        universal language of love, hope, and resilience, teaching us that, like
        them, we can endure challenges and emerge even more vibrant than
        before."
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        "A green pasture is nature's sanctuary, a calming expanse of life and
        renewal. It symbolizes peace, abundance, and the quiet strength of the
        earth beneath our feet. In its soft blades of grass, we find a refuge
        from the chaos of life, a reminder that growth happens in the stillness.
        Green pastures are a testament to nature's resilience, flourishing under
        the sun and rain, and offering us a space to reflect, rest, and
        reconnect with the natural world. They teach us the value of patience
        and the beauty of steady, quiet growth."
